Project goal:  Video Feed with Face Detection and "Surprise" Effects

Overview:

This Python application provides a real-time video feed with face detection capabilities and an interactive "Surprise" mode. The project is designed to showcase the integration of computer vision and graphical user interfaces using the following technologies:

- OpenCV (cv2): For capturing and processing the video feed.
- Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Pillow (PIL): For image processing and display.
- face_recognition: For real-time face detection.

Features:

- Real-time video feed from your webcam.
- Face detection using the face_recognition library.
- An interactive "Surprise" mode that applies random color effects to the video feed when toggled on.
- User-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction.

Requirements:

Before running the application, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- Tkinter
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)
- face_recognition

Goals:

The main goals of this project was to learn about computer vision using face detection, and incorporate this knowledge and features into a tkinter GUI, alongside some interesting features such as: 

- the always changing frame around the detected face.
- Everytime the suprise button is pressed, a random color scheme is applied, out of several possible color schemes.
